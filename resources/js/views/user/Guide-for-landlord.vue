                            <h4 class="text-success">Include Details of Your Property</h4>
                            <p>Since Tenants would only be interested in your property for rent if they find it useful for them. I.e. it’s the best practice to include every detail of your property. Tenants would want to know the rent price, the address,
                                the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, amenities, and nearby attractions—the more informative the listing, the better. It’s also a good idea to upload clear photos of every room and common space, as tenants will likely be
                                more interested if they can easily visualize the space.</p>
                            <h4 class="text-success">Set Right Rent Price</h4>
                            <p>The Rent price you would set is a crucial factor in determining how quickly your property is rented. To set the right rent price, we recommend researching your market to learn what the fairmarket rent price is in your area.
                                Pricing your rental at the rent price that makes sense in your location can mean the difference between vacancies and attracting good tenants so you can rent your property quickly.</p>
                            <h4 class="text-success">Have your Say</h4>
                            <p>You may enforce your own rules by contacting us either online or via phone or personally. The important rule which you may want us to enforce is regarding the late rent fee. You can allow a grace period and we would make sure

                            <p>The easier it is to pay rent, the more likely your tenant will pay. Tenants can even set up scheduled payments so their rent is automatically taken out of their account. Tenants love the convenience that online payments offer,
                                and you will love getting your payments on time every month. Make Sure to add your rent collection method. Double-check before submitting your financial details such as Bank account, Credit card, PayPal etc.</p>
